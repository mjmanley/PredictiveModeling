# Deploying or refreshing a predictive model

To deploy or refresh a predictive model using the  service, you use an API call to upload a file that contains the IBM® SPSS®
Modeler developed scoring branch. It is made available for scoring data in your applications. Each
model file is given a context ID as a convenient alias to use for
referencing the deployed model in subsequent service calls. If a
model exists for a context ID, it is replaced by this PUT call as
a means of refreshing the predictive analytics in use by your
applications.
{: shortdesc}

```
PUT http://{PA Bluemix load balancer
URL}/pm/v1/model/{contextId}?accesskey={access_key for this bound
application}
```
{: codeblock}

Request example:

```
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data
    Parameters:
        Form parameters:
            model_file: the model file to upload
        Path parameters:
            contextId: the unique identifier to assign to your model or a reference to the deployed model to refresh
        Query Parameters:
            accesskey: access_key from env.VCAP_SERVICES
```
{: codeblock}

Response when the deployment succeeds:

```
    Content-Type: application/json
    Status code: 200
    body:
        {
           "flag":true, 
           "message":"detailed information"  
         }
```
{: codeblock}

Response when the deployment fails:

```
    Content-Type: application/json
    Status code: 200
    body:
        {
           "flag":false, 
           "message":"reason"
        }
```
