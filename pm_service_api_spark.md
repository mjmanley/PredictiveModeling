# REST API

The {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} service is a set of REST APIs called from
any programming language, permitting integration of Data Science
Experience developed analytics in your applications. Bind your
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} applications to the {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} service instance and
generate the predictive analytics that your applications need to
deliver higher value to your users. Manage models in the
[administration dashboard](pm_service_ui_spark.html), and use the dashboard to create online,
batch, or streaming deployments integrated with your
applications.
{: shortdesc}

Develop applications against Spark, Python and IBM® SPSS® models that are deployed on a service instance
through the powerful [REST APIs](https://watson-ml-api.mybluemix.net/):

*  Retrieve the metadata for a given predictive model
*  Deploy models and manage deployed models
    *  Online deployment (scoring)
    *  Batch deployment (supporting IBM Cloud Object Storage and {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort}})
    *  Stream deployment (supporting IBM Cloud Message Hub)
*  Retrieve the metadata for a given deployment
*  Monitor and retrain deployed models using continuous learning system
*  Generate predictive analytics by making score requests against
   deployed models

See the following sections for examples of REST API use:

*  [Deploying online models](pm_service_api_spark_online.html)
*  [Scoring online models](pm_service_api_develop_score.html)
*  [Deploying batch models](pm_service_api_spark_batch.html)
*  [Deploying stream models](pm_service_api_spark_streaming.html)
*  [Continuous learning system](pm_service_api_spark_learning_system.html)
